1. make file reader method for items, similar to the one for entities.
 1.1 Move all current items to text files.
 1.2 Improve file reader. Entity(fileName) is almost 100 lines, this can be smaller, I'm sure.
     It can be very short (~10 lines), but then the text file will have to be one value per line (bad readability).
